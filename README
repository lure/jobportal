This is an education project made for a Java course.
The main tasks was to show ORM and IoC concepts with some object oriented web-framework. Project contains separated
branch with mongoDB backend, accessed via Spring-Data.
Nearly all templates were found on Template World (http://templateworld.com).

sampledataFlat.xml
- Contains some account records among with job expirience. You're free to add some more records as long as '1' index
still occupied by admin record.

== General suggestion ==
- It makes sence to populate HomePage.html with some more data just to make it more believable.
- div with `wicket:id="feedback"` requires some particular css style.
- There is nearly no unit tests. While it was intended to emphasize on TDD advantage I had no time to forestall code
with tests.



== Known bugs ==
- All templates lack the correct html.
- PersonPage marking breaks on empty fields
- Editor has some huge problems and must be replaced with any robust analog.
- description in a 'view' mode leaves some HTML tags unrendered.
- Localization is undone and mostly russian consts mixed with English.
